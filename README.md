# Fingerprint-Matching
This project takes in an image of a finger, then preprocesses this input image to extract the fingerprint and using SIFT, checks if this fingerprint is already present in the database.
The codes are to be run in the following order:
1) remove_back.py
2) preprocess.py
3) sift_detect.py (in the output folder)
